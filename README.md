#### Description:

Welcome to Goat Quotes, a unique platform to share and explore quotes from a variety of sources. Developed as the final project for a Harvard University online course (CS50), this application offers an interactive environment to share and discover favorite quotes, be it from an all-time favorite book, an unforgettable movie, or a deeply impactful anime. While you're free to share your beloved quotes, you can also delve into the treasure trove of inspirational quotes shared by others in the Goat Quotes community.

Goat Quotes was fully developed by myself using JavaScript. The features of this application include a custom authentication system, a user-friendly interface for making posts (which users can like, dislike, or bookmark), and profile management features.

#### Technologies Used

The following technologies were leveraged in the making of Goat Quotes:

Backend

PostgreSQL: A potent, open-source object-relational database system utilized via a Docker container to ensure smooth data management.
TypeORM: This ORM, compatible with NodeJS, TypeScript, and JavaScript, handles database queries in PostgreSQL.
Passport: This Express.js middleware offers a comprehensive suite of strategies for authentication, adding to the security of the application.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For ensuring secure transmission of information across the network.

Frontend
ReactJS: This JavaScript library plays a significant role in building engaging user interfaces.
React Router: This forms a collection of navigational components ensuring a seamless navigation experience throughout the application.
React Hook Form: This offers a high-performing, flexible, and extensible forms solution with a user-friendly validation system.
Zod: A validation library for TypeScript and JavaScript, enhancing the user experience by checking the correctness of input data.
Material-UI: This popular React UI framework contributes to the sleek and responsive design of the application.
